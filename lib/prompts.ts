      Imagine there is a spectrum for how confident you are in your answer. That might be on a scale of:

      - **highly_confident**: Sources contain explicit information that directly answer the customer question without any ambiguity.
      - **somewhat_confident**: Sources contain a likely direct answer but there are potential small caveats or ambiguities.
      - **not_confident**: Sources contain potentially relevant information but do not directly/explicitly answer the primary query or there are ambiguities.
      - **no_relevant_sources**: Sources do not contain information directly relevant to the user question.');
